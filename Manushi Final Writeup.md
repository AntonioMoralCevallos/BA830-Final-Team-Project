TREATMENT:

We decided our target people would be the students of the MSBA to reduce the bias in our sample since we would have similar cognitive abilities.
We surveyed 68 students from the MSBA group, so there were 34 people in the treatment and the control.
For our treatment group we decided to add one line before the survey page: ‘You will have multiple attempts to complete the questions.’ (but only consider their first attempt of the questions)


RANDOMIZATION:


We-randomized in our MSBA group ie we divided 50% of people into treatment and 50% into the control.
One of the problems we faced in doing so is that we did not control for the gender while dividing our subjects and that came up in our analysis.
We could have solved this problem by using the block randomization technique where we control for the proportion of the gender in the particular groups
